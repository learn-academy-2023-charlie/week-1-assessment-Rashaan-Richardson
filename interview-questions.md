# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:
A statment that completes a iteration is the said condition is met 

Researched answer:
Conditionals are expressions that evaluate to either true or false. They are mostly used to determine Program Flow through if statements and while loops.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
Git is a process for handling different versions of code and to make updates. Github is just a repository that handles this. Such as a filing cabinet

Researched answer:
While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
The && or || operators. Since they are only checking if something is true or false. Which are boolean values

Researched answer:
The logical OR ( || ) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer:
The value is what is contained in the array. The index is just where it is located

Researched answer:
An array is an object that stores many values of the same type. An array element is one value in an array. An array index is an integer indicating a position in an array. Like Strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, that is, array indexes start with 0.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
both are mutable objects. Both can be objects of a larger object. Arrays contain other data types. While string are a primative type

Researched answer:
Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements. Arrays can contain any data type (char short int even other arrays) while strings are usually ASCII characters terminated with a NULL (0) character.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
when two or more people work on one coding project. Ideally oen person will 'drive' and the other will give directions.

Researched answer:
Describe the roles in Pair Programming
The classic metaphor in pair programming is the driver and navigator. The driver is at the wheel, the navigator looks at the map; the driver types, the navigator describes the problem and solution

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
A function that takes in a function as a parameter

2. Jest:
The tool used for testing JavaScript code

3. Objects:
a standalone entity, with properties and type

4. Method:
Actions that can be preformed on an object

5. Classes:
Blueprints for code. Typically contains multiple classes
